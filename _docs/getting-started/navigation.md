## The main menu

To find screens in SIMS:

1. Open the **Menu**.

{% include image.html url="shots/menu.png" title="Menu**" %}

{:start="2"}
1. Type the name of the screen into the **Menu Search** {% include icon.html url="search" title="Search" %}.

{% include image.html url="shots/menusearch.png" title="The **Menu search**" %}

## Frequently used

For quick access to screens you use often, we list them in the **Frequently Used** panel.

{% include image.html url="shots/frequentlyused.png" title="Frequently Used" %}

 The more often you use a screen, the higher up the list it'll appear.

## Menu organisation

The menu groups screens into 'functional' areas. These groupings help you when your task involves several screens. E.g., managing your pastoral structure.

{% include image.html url="shots/menuorganisation.png" title="Grouped menu items" %}

> If the menu item has extra information, you can hover over the **Help Symbol** {% include icon.html url="question-circle" title="Search" %}.

## Quick links

**Quick Links** are shortcuts to regularly used screens.

{% include image.html url="shots/quick-links.png" title="The **Quick Links**" %}

## Multitasking

To help you switch between your current activities, we keep your current screens open as **Tabs** at the bottom of the screen.

{% include image.html url="shots/tabs.png" title="The **Tabs**" %}

 {% include image.html url="shots/menu.png" title="The Main Menu" %}

{:start="2"}
2. Type the name of the screen into the **Menu Search** {% include icon.html url="search" title="Search" %}.

## Frequently used

For quick access to commonly used screens, we list often used screens in the **Frequently Used** list.

## Menu organisation

Our menu lists the screens grouped into areas.

If the menu item has extra information, you can hover over the **Help Symbol** {% include icon.html url="question-circle" title="Search" %}.

## Quick links

*Quick Links* are shortcuts to regularly used screens.

## Multitasking

To help you switch between your current activities, we keep your current screens open as **Tabs** at the bottom of the screen.

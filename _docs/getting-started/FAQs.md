{% include faq.html explain="How do I change the date to **UK format**" %}

If the dates in SIMS are not displaying in the UK format, i.e. dd/MM/yyyy, then this means your browser or operating system's **Language and Region** settings are *probably* set to US English.

Changing the **Language and Region** settings depend upon your browser and operating system. 

Please try googling to find how to change your settings.

For example, try:

* [Windows 10 edge change date to UK format](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Windows+10+edge+change+date+to+UK+format){:target="_blank"}
* [Window 7 chrome change date to UK format](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Window+7+chrome+change+date+to+UK+format){:target="_blank"}
* [MacOS safari change date to UK format](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=MacOS+safari+change+date+to+UK+format){:target="_blank"}
* [IOS safari change date to UK format](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=IOS+safari+change+date+to+UK+format){:target="_blank"}

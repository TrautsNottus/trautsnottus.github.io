{% include faq.html explain="Filtering" %}

You can use any column on the screen as a filter, e.g., you can focus on the pupils eligible for Pupil Premium.

To apply a filter, open the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Column Menu" %} and choose your filter options from the **Filter** panel.

You can see if a filter is applied to a column by the icon shown in the column heading:

* A drop-down arrow {% include icon.html url="caret-down" title="Down Arrow" %} means no filtering is applied.
* A filter icon {% include icon.html url="filter" title="Filter" %}  means that a filter is applied.

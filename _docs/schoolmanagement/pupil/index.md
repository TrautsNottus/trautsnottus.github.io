# Managing Pupils

There are several ways in which a new pupil can be added or removed from SIMS:

Manual entry. 

Importing via CTF (although some details will usually have been entered into SIMS before the CTF is imported). 
Importing via ADT and/or ATF (Admissions Code of Practice for England). 
Via the admissions process (adding as a pre-admission child then offering, accepting and admitting).

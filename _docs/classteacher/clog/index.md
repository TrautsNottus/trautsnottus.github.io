title: The Class Log
---

A great new way for teachers to interact with important information on their class.
{:.lead}

Many of your daily tasks can be made easier with the Class Log:

* [Taking the register](take-register)
* [Recording lunches](dinner-register)
* [Award conduct points](conduct)
* [Recording notes](notes)

## Opening the Class Log

1. Open the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Menu" %}.
2. Use the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Menu Search" %} to find **Class Log**.
3. Choose your class.

> For class teachers, there's a shortcut to **Class Log** in the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Quick Links" %}.

{% include faq.html explain="Filter By panel" %}

Use the **Filter By** panel to find and focus on specific pupils. E.g.:

* Boys or girls
* Who has a birthday this week
* Who receives free school meals
* Who receives Pupil Premium

By default, we hide the **Filter By** panel. To open the **Filter By** panel, click the **Filter** {% include icon.html url="filter" title="Filter" %} button on the toolbar.

{% include faq-end.html  %}

{% include faq.html explain="Flagged pupil information" %}

The pupil information flags highlight details about pupils you need to be aware. E.g.:

* Medical conditions
* SEND needs
* Pinned notes from their [Pupil Log](../plog/)
* Quick notes from their Pupil Record

By default, we hide the pupil information flags. To see the pupil information flags change the **Privacy** setting from **Hide Pupil Info** to **Show Pupil Info**.

> Remember to turn the pupil information flags off when you use the Class Log on the whiteboard.

{% include faq.html explain="Getting more pupil information" %}

Clicking on a pupilâ€™s name shows you more details about them, e.g. their date of birth, achievement and behaviour summary.

From the panel, you can jump out to other screens in SIMS to find out more detail information.

{% include faq-end.html  %}

{% include faq.html explain="Sorting your class" %}

You can sort the pupils in your class by ascending or descending order on their:

* Name
* Age
* Good or bad behaviour

To apply sorting to you class, open the **Sort By** panel and choose from the sorting options.

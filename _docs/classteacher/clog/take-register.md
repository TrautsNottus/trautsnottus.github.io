## Lateness

When a pupil arrives late for registration, you can change the Absent mark to Late (L) and record the number of minutes Late.

We calculate how late the pupil is for you.  But it's up to you to decide what you want to record.

## Viewing and Adding Notes

You can add, amend or delete comments about a pupil attendance or absence by clicking the Add Note button.

The Add Note button highlights when a comment has been recorded for a pupil.

> Note: The note should relate to the pupil's attendance or absence for that registration. Use Pupil Log Notes to record notes.

## Additional Marks

We've made it easy to enter Present, Absent or Late marks. But if you need to record other marks, click the Additional Marks button.

> Note: Only certain marks require you to enter minutes late.

## Flood Fill

You can enter the same mark for multiple pupils.  Select the pupils by clicking the pupil's image and use the Flood Fill actions in the toolbar.

> Note: There's tick shown on the top left of the pupil to indicate that they're selected.

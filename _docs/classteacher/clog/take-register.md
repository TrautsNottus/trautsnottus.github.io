## Recording Lateness

If a pupil arrives late for registration, you can change the Absent mark to Late  by clicking the **L** button on the pupil and record the number of minutes Late.

We calculate how late the pupil is for you.  But it's up to you to decide what you want to record.

## Viewing and Adding Notes

You can add, amend or delete comments about a pupil attendance or absence by clicking the **Add Note** button.

The **Add Note** button highlights when a comment has been recorded for a pupil.

> The note should relate to the pupil's attendance or absence for that registration. Use Pupil Log Notes to record notes.

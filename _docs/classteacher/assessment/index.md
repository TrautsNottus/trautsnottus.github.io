A Marksheet is a spreadsheet, where pupil are listed in rows, and the assessments are listed in columns ({% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Aspects" %}).

In SIMS are two types of Marksheet:

1. [General Marksheets](ms-ass),used for {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Summative" %} assessments, e.g., the end of Key Stage
1. [Programme of Study Tracking Sheets](ms-pos), used for ongoing {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Formative" %} evaluation; where you can assess against the curriculum learning objectives.

> As a teacher, you have access to Marksheets from the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Quick Links" %}.

{% include faq.html explain="Marksheet creation" %}

Marksheets are created by your Assessment Coordinator.

An Assessment Coordinator will create a template for a Marksheet. A template defines the columns that will appear in the Marksheet.

By associating the template with one or more pupil groups, Marksheets can be created for each supervisor of each group.

As a class teacher, you will see only those Marksheets relevant to you.

Data entry columns
: Data entry columns enable you to enter assessment results for each pupil listed in the Marksheet.

Read-only columns
: Some columns on the Marksheet may be read-only. Read-only columns appear greyed-out. These columns are either for information or are the result of a calculation.

Formula columns
: A Formula performs calculations or other actions on the data in your Marksheet. 

Formula columns are indicated by an {% include icon.html url="formula-function" title="Formula Icon" %} symbol in the column header.

To see details of the Formula, open the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Column Menu" %} and click {% include icon.html url="formula" title="Take Formula" %} **View Formula**.

A marksheet is a spreadsheet, where pupil are listed in rows, and the assessments are listed in columns ({% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Aspects" %}).

In SIMS are three types of marksheet:

1. [General Marksheets](marksheets/ms-ass), used for {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Summative" %} assessments, e.g., the end of Key Stage
1. [Programme of Study Tracking Sheets](marksheets/ms-pos), used for ongoing {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Formative" %} evaluation; where you can assess against the curriculum learning objectives.
1. [Historical Marksheets](marksheets/ms-historical), used for changing results in the past.

> As a teacher, you have access to marksheets from the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Quick Links" %}.

{% include faq.html explain="Marksheet creation" %}

Marksheets are created by your Assessment Coordinator.

An Assessment Coordinator creates a template for a marksheet. A template defines the columns that appear in the marksheet.

By associating the template with one or more pupil groups, Marksheets can be created for each supervisor of each group.

As a class teacher, you'll see only those marksheets relevant to you.

{% include faq.html explain="Types of columns" %}

There are several types of columns that make up a marksheet:

Data entry columns
: Data entry columns enable you to enter assessment results for each pupil listed in the marksheet.

Read-only columns
: Columns on the marksheet can be read-only. Read-only columns appear greyed-out. These columns are either for information or are the result of a calculation.

Formula columns
: A formula performs calculations or other actions on the data in your marksheet.

Formula columns are indicated by an {% include icon.html url="formula-function" title="Formula Icon" %} symbol in the column header.

To see details of the formula, open the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Column Menu" %} and click {% include icon.html url="formula" title="Take Formula" %} **View Formula**.

Pupil information columns
: Pupil information column display details about pupil, e.g., their name, class, year group.

Clicking on a pupil's name shows you more details about them, e.g. their photo, date of birth.

You can add additional pupil information to ta marksheet for more context, e.g. if you wanted to see how your pupil premium children are doing.

> You can add or remove the pupil information columns by clicking **Pupil Info Columns** {% include icon.html url="pupilrecord" title="Pupil Info Columns" %} on the toolbar.

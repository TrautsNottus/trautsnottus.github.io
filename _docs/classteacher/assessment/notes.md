# Viewing and adding notes

You can add, amend or delete notes on a pupil's results by choosing the cell and clicking the **Edit Note** {% include icon.html url="comment-o" title="Edit Note" %} button.

You can record why a result has changed or perhaps why their performance was not as expected, e.g. poor health, bereavement.

The indicator in the top right of a cell highlights if a note has been recorded for a pupil.

In SIMS are two types of Marksheet:

1. **General Marksheets,** used for summative assessments, e.g., the end of Key Stage. [Learn More](ms-ass).
1. **Programme of Study Tracking Sheets**, used for ongoing formative evaluation; where you can assess against the curriculum learning objectives. [Learn More](ms-pos).

## Marksheet creation

Marksheets are created by your Assessment Coordinator.

An Assessment Coordinator will create a template for a Marksheet. A template defines the columns that will appear in the Marksheet.

By associating the template with one or more pupil groups, Marksheets can be created for each supervisor of each group.

As a class teacher, you will see only those Marksheets relevant to you.

## Types of Columns

Some columns on the Marksheet may be read-only. Read-only columns appear greyed-out. These columns are either for information or are the result of a calculation. form

 As you enter results into a Marksheet, a history of the results is preserved. This facilitates the analysis of your pupil's progress.

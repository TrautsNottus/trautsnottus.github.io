On the tracking sheet, you can record assessments at the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Strand" %} level, or the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Subject" %} level.

Further, you can record Comments and Next Steps. You can use this information later in reports for parents, or to support further planning.

On the tracking sheet, a cell with solid colouring indicates the current assessment.

A cell with diagonal shading shows a previous assessment, making it easy to see what assessments need updating.

## Analysis

The tracking sheet has features to help you see if pupils are excelling, or falling behind. You can use this information to focus your support.

{% include faq.html explain="Expectations achieved" %}

The tracking sheet shows you the percentage of pupils meeting both the DfE and schools expectations. The percentage shows how many targeted skills are assessed as Secured or higher.

{% include faq-end.html  %}

{% include faq.html explain="Summary panel" %}

At the bottom of the tracking sheet is a summary panel.

From the summary panel you can see the number and percentage of pupils mastering, achieving, or not achieving a skill.

The calculations are based on how many pupils are attaining the Secured grade or higher.

By default, we hide the summary panel. To see the summary panel click the **Summary** button at the bottom of the tracking sheet.

{% include faq-end.html  %}

{% include faq.html explain="Grade distribution" %}

You can see grade distribution for your class by changing the **Marksheet View** from **Spreadsheet** {% include icon.html url="table" title="Spreadsheet" %} to **Analysis** {% include icon.html url="bar-chart" title="Analysis View" %} on the toolbar.

{% include faq-end.html  %}

{% include faq.html explain="Additional pupil information" %}

You can add additional pupil information to the tracking sheet for more context, e.g. if you wanted to see how your pupil premium children are doing.

You can add or remove the pupil information columns by clicking **Pupil Info Columns** {% include icon.html url="pupilrecord" title="Pupil Info Columns" %} on the toolbar.

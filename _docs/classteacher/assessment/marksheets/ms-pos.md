## Analysis

The Attainment Targets are tracked half termly. We hold the history of each assessment so you can analyse pupil progress over time.

The Tracking Sheet has features to help you see if pupils are excelling, or falling behind. You can use this information to focus your support.

## Expectations achieved

The Tracking Sheet shows you the percentage of pupils meeting both the DfE and schools expectations. The percentage shows how many targeted skills are assessed as Secured or higher.

## Summary

At the bottom of the Tracking Sheet is the Summary Panel.

From the Summary Panel you can see the number and percentage of pupils Mastering, Achieving, or not Achieving a skill.

The calculations are based on how many pupils are attaining the Secured grade or higher.

## Analysis view

## Grade distribution

You can see grade distribution for your class by changing the Marksheet View to Analysis on the toolbar.

## Additional pupil information

You can add additional pupil information to the Tracking Sheet for more context, e.g. if you wanted to see how your pupil premium children are doing.

Click Pupil Info Columns on the toolbar.

## Sorting and Filtering

You can sort any column on the Tracking Sheet, e.g., you can sort on the pupils by their results.

You can use any column on the Tracking Sheet as a filter, e.g., you can focus on the pupils eligible for Pupil Premium.

By applying multiple filters, you can focus your attention on a particular group of pupils.

> We show  Marksheets created for your classes.

Marksheets can get large in some schools. We include column filtering to help you focus on the assessments relevant to what you want to see today. E.g., you can focus on the year to Autumn term. Or you could choose to filter the Marksheet to a specific subject.

# Data Entry

You can enter values into the Tracking Sheet with your keyboard. Alternatively, use the Result Picker.

The Result Picker shows you what grades are available for the assessment. The Result Picker makes it easy to set the grades by tapping on the grade. 

The Assessment coordinator can change the grades and their descriptions to meet the needs of the school.

At the bottom of the Marksheet is the Summary Panel.

From the Summary Panel, you get an overview of the grades entered and the mean and median grades. 

## Additional pupil information

You can add additional pupil information to the MarkSheet for more context, e.g. if you wanted to see how your pupil premium children are doing.

Click Pupil Info Columns on the toolbar.

You can use any column on the Tracking Sheet as a filter. 
E.g., if you want to see pupil premium children, you can apply a filter to that column.

Open the column menu and choose the filters.

By applying many filters, you can further narrow your focus to a specific group of pupils.

Removing a filter sets the Marksheet by choosing XX from the column menu.

## Adding Columns

You can add ad-hoc columns to a Marksheet. E.g., If you decide to challenge the class to a quick spelling test and you want to record the outcome.

The additional column only affects this marksheet.
